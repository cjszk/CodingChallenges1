Educated assumptions made:
    - Should have 10 digits, 11 if the country code for US is already provided.
    - E.164 Format is +12345678901

In JavaScript
1. Filter the string for only the numbers.
    This is done by:
    a. Splitting the string into an array of indivual characters.
    b. Testing to see if the string character is a number by using parseInt.
        (because 0 would return false, which we don't want, 
        we test to see if the number is less than 10 instead of just returning the value directly)
    c. Use join('') to reassemble the string with just the numbers.
2. Now that we have a variable that contains a string of just the integers we want,
    we check to see if the country code is already included in the string. If so,
    the string should have a total of 11 digits and start with 1. This is done in the first if block.
    If this if block passes, we return + along with the 11 digits.
3. If the first if block does not return, this means that the length is not 11 and the country code is not included.
    We therefore check to see if the numbers provided are valid for a US phone number by checking to see if the length is exactly 10,
    if it isn't,  we return null since it is not a proper US phone number.
4. If the second if block doesn't pass, the number is exactly 10 digits and we can immediately format it into E164 format
    by adding + and 1

Other Notes:
    This solution took me about 20 minutes. I considered using RegEx, but I felt immediately 
    more comfortable using array methods and if statements to create this solution.
